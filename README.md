# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6
## Purpose
I have created code, with some sample print-outs to search over 2,000 cities and their associated weather. Three main files contain the final code:
### Weather Database
This folder has a python code that searches from the open weather API to create a CSV with various cities weather, based upon a random latitude and longitude metrics.
### Vacation Search
This folder has a python code that searches the weather database csv for a specific range of temperature and outputs into a CSV the resulting cities that meet this range of temperatures. It also produces a map that shows the location on google maps of these cities.
### Vacation Itinerary
This folder contains python code that pulls the data from the vacation search folder. Once 4 cities are selected, it prints out a map of the travel route as well as a map with hotel/location details.
